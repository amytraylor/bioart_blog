I am working on creating physical controllers and other manipulatives
for a virtual reality project.

I created a rock like object out of clay because I wanted the object to have a 
hand-made feel to it. I then scanned the object and 3D printed it in PLA.

The result is an object for finger indentations for gripping and a pleasant lumpy
texture like unsmooted clay. 

The plan is to embed electronics inside the object to make the controller.

The second object is a prototype for a large scale controller that would be mounted on the wall or be
installed in a table with electronic components inside.
